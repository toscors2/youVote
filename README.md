youVote voting app

Designed to be an easy to use and manipulate voting system for small to mid-size entertainment venues.  At the time of this commit youVote is currently being utilized as a voting app for a Voice like karaoke contest.  It processes over 500 votes from audience members that have received tickets in one way or the other, in a 30 minute span and displays back live data results in a bargraph form.  

I still have a lot of work to do to it.  My next objective is making a configuration module for easy setup of contestants, type of voting, validation rules, etc... 

If you're reading this, thanks and if you view my files... any help is appreciated at this point :)
